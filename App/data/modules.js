          1. Question: Why does the sky appear blue?
          2. Research: Light travels in waves and interacts with particles
          3. Hypothesis: The sky appears blue due to light scattering
          4. Experiment: Observe sky color at different times
          5. Analysis: Compare observations with predictions
          6. Conclusion: Rayleigh scattering causes blue appearance`

        content: `## States of Matter

          Matter exists in various states:
          1. Solid: Definite shape and volume (e.g., ice)
          2. Liquid: Takes the shape of the container, fixed volume (e.g., water)
          3. Gas: No fixed shape or volume (e.g., oxygen)
          4. Plasma: Ionized gases found in stars

          Key Transitions:
          - Melting: Solid to liquid
          - Evaporation: Liquid to gas
          - Sublimation: Solid to gas directly`

        content: `## Newton's Laws of Motion

          1. First Law: An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a force (Inertia).
          2. Second Law: Force = Mass × Acceleration (F = ma).
          3. Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

          Applications:
          - First Law: Seat belts in cars
          - Second Law: Pushing a shopping cart
          - Third Law: Rocket propulsion`

        title: '# Photosynthesis',
        content: `## Photosynthesis

          Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their food using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water.

          Equation:
          6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

          Key Components:
          1. Chloroplasts: Contain chlorophyll, the green pigment.
          2. Light Energy: Absorbed from the sun.
          3. Stomata: Allow gas exchange in leaves.

          Importance:
          - Produces oxygen for life.
          - Converts solar energy into chemical energy.`

        content: `## The Water Cycle

          The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the Earth's surface.

          Stages:
          1. Evaporation: Water turns into vapor due to heat.
          2. Condensation: Water vapor forms clouds.
          3. Precipitation: Rain, snow, or hail falls to the ground.
          4. Collection: Water gathers in rivers, lakes, and oceans.

          Importance:
          - Distributes water across the planet.
          - Maintains ecosystems and weather patterns.`

        content: `## Atoms and Molecules

        Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. When atoms combine, they form molecules.

        Structure of an Atom:
        - Protons: Positively charged particles in the nucleus.
        - Neutrons: Neutral particles in the nucleus.
        - Electrons: Negatively charged particles orbiting the nucleus.

        Examples:
        - Water (H₂O): 2 Hydrogen + 1 Oxygen
        - Carbon Dioxide (CO₂): 1 Carbon + 2 Oxygen

        Key Concept:
        - Molecules are formed through chemical bonds (e.g., ionic, covalent).`
