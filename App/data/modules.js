This Self-Learning Module (SLM) is prepared so that you, our dear learners, can continue your studies and learn while at home. Activities, questions, directions, exercises, and discussions are carefully stated for you to understand each lesson.
Each SLM is composed of different parts. Each part shall guide you step-by-step as you discover and understand the lesson prepared for you.
Pretests are provided to measure your prior knowledge on lessons in each SLM. This will tell you if you need to proceed on completing this module or if you need to ask your facilitator or your teacher’s assistance for better understanding of the lesson. At the end of each module, you need to answer the posttest to self-check your learning. Answer keys are provided for each activity and test. We trust that you will be honest in using these.
In addition to the material in the main text, Notes to the Teacher are also provided to our facilitators and parents for strategies and reminders on how they can best help you on your home-based learning.
Please use this module with care. Do not put unnecessary marks on any part of this SLM. Use a separate sheet of paper in answering the exercises and tests. And read the instructions carefully before performing each task.
If you have any questions in using this SLM or any difficulty in answering the tasks in this module, do not hesitate to consult your teacher or facilitator.

How will you describe the Earth? You might say, it is big and sturdy. Others might say, it is covered with land and water. It is a place filled with different landscapes and landforms such as mountains and volcanoes. But do you know how these landforms are developed or how do they relate to earthquake epicenters?
This module will provide you with information and simple activities that will help you understand Plate Tectonics based on the distribution of active volcanoes, earthquake epicenters, and mountain ranges on our planet.
After going through this module, you are expected to:

Matter exists in various states:
1. describe and relate the distribution of active volcanoes, earthquake epicenters, and major mountain belts to Plate Tectonic Theory (S10ES – Ia-j-36.1);
2. enumerate ways to ensure disaster preparedness during earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions; and
3. suggest ways by which one can contribute to government efforts in reducing damage due to earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions.

Going through this module can be a meaningful learning experience. All you need to do is make use of your time and resources efficiently. To do this, here are some tips for you:

1. Take the pretest before reading the rest of the module.
2. Take time in reading and understanding the lesson. Follow the instructions carefully. Do all activities diligently. It is better to be slow but sure than to hurry and miss the concepts you are supposed to learn.
3. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers in each activity or
assessment. Don’t forget to write your name. Label it properly.
4. Try to recall and connect the ideas about the Earth that you had in the lower years. Use the concept discussed in the lesson to explain the results of the activities or performance tasks.
5. Be honest. When doing the activities, record only what you have observed. Take the assessments after each activity, but do not turn to the Answer Key page unless you are done with the entire module.
6. Don’t hesitate to ask. If you need to clarify something, approach or contact your teacher or any knowledgeable person available to help you. You may also look into other references for further information.
7. Take the posttest prepared at the end of the module, so you can assess how much you have learned from this module.
8. You can check your answers in the activities, self-assessments, and posttest after you finished the entire module to know how much you have gained from the lesson and the activities.

        content: `Our Earth has four layers consisting of different materials, namely, crust, mantle, inner, and outer core. For this module, we will focus on the lithosphere which is composed of the crust and the upper mantle.
The lithosphere is said to be in constant but very slow motion. These motions are not the same everywhere. This movement of the lithosphere is called tectonics.
According to the Plate Tectonics Theory, the entire lithosphere of the Earth is broken into numerous segments called plates (see Figure 1). The arrows show the direction of the plate movement and the other lines are the fault lines.

Do you notice in Figure 1 that there are seven relatively large plates and several smaller ones, including the Philippine plate? Can you remember all their names? Please do the activity below to see how these plates relate to earthquakes, volcanism, and mountain formation.

Rethink the Risks
You have seen the maps of the Pacific Ring of Fire in the previous activity. This time let’s see how our country, Philippines, is at risk of disasters related to geologic activities. As we are known to be resilient (flexible), we have high hopes that our resilience could also mean preparedness at all times.
Study the hazard maps found on pages 14-17 that will show you areas in our country that are prone to natural disasters like earthquakes (Figure 3), landslides Figure 4), volcanic eruptions (Figure 5), and tsunamis (Figure 6).
Look at the geographical or political map of the Philippines on page 13. Try to compare the areas in Figures 3 to 6 (pages 14-17) provinces with darker colors. These are the high-risk areas to the specified natural disasters.

Great job! You are almost done with this module. Let’s summarize what you have learned from the lesson and activities by choosing the correct word inside the parentheses. Use a separate sheet of paper and write only your answer.

1-3.	The crust and a part of the upper mantle make up the (continent, lithosphere). It is subdivided into portions called plates. (Continents, Plates) are large pieces of the upper few hundred kilometers of Earth that move as a single unit as it (floats, moves) above the mantle.

4-5.	There are two kinds of crust: (Continental, Crustal) plates which are thicker but less dense, and Oceanic plates which are thinner but (compact, denser).

6-8.	Plate Tectonics is a (law, theory) which suggests that Earth’s crust is made up of plates that constantly (move, rotate) and interact in various ways, thus, producing earthquakes, mountains, volcanoes, and other (geologic, land) features.

9. The plate that pushes the Philippine Plate towards the (Eurasian, Indo- Australian) plate is the Pacific Plate.

10-12. The world’s earthquakes, (eruptions, volcanoes), and mountain ranges are not randomly distributed over the Earth’s surface. They are both situated at the same (location, place) near the (center, edges) of the continents.

13-15.		Geologic activities such as (ethnicity, seismicity) or the occurrence of earthquake, (extravasation, volcanism), and mountain formations are the (basis, reasons) of scientists in dividing Earth’s lithosphere.

        title: '# Understanding Plate Boundaries',
        content: `
**Key Concept:**
Plate boundaries are areas where tectonic plates meet and interact. These interactions lead to various geological features and events.

There are three main types of plate boundaries:

**1. Convergent Boundaries (Collision Zones)**
- Two plates move toward each other
- Creates mountains, trenches, and volcanoes
- Example: The Himalayan Mountains formed when Indian Plate collided with Eurasian Plate

**2. Divergent Boundaries (Spreading Zones)**
- Two plates move away from each other
- Creates rift valleys and new crust
- Example: The Mid-Atlantic Ridge

**3. Transform Boundaries**
- Plates slide past each other horizontally
- Creates fault lines and earthquakes
- Example: San Andreas Fault in California

        title: '# Volcanic Formation and Types',
        content: `
**What is a Volcano**
A volcano is an opening in Earth's crust where magma, gases, and ash escape to the surface.

**Important Note:**
Volcanoes typically form at convergent and divergent plate boundaries, though some form at hotspots within plates.

**Types of Volcanoes:**

1. **Shield Volcanoes**
- Broad, gentle slopes
- Built from fluid lava flows
- Example: Mauna Loa in Hawaii

2. **Stratovolcanoes (Composite Volcanoes)**
- Steep, conical shape
- Built from layers of lava and ash
- Example: Mount Mayon in Philippines

3. **Cinder Cones**
- Small, steep-sided
- Built from explosive eruptions
- Example: Taal Volcano's satellite cones

**Safety Note:**
Living near volcanoes requires awareness of warning signs and evacuation procedures.

        title: '# Understanding Earthquakes',
        content: `
**What is an Earthquake?**
          An earthquake is the shaking of Earth's surface caused by sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust.
      
**Key Terms:**
      
- **Focus (Hypocenter)**: The point where the earthquake originates
- **Epicenter**: The point on Earth's surface directly above the focus
- **Seismic Waves**: Energy waves that travel through Earth during an earthquake

**Measurement:**
Earthquakes are measured using:
- Richter Scale (magnitude)
- Modified Mercalli Scale (intensity)

**Earthquake Safety Tips:**
1. Drop, Cover, and Hold On
2. Stay away from windows
3. Have an emergency kit ready
4. Know your evacuation route

        content: `
**What are Mountains?**
Mountains are large landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings, generally exhibiting steep slopes.

**Types of Mountains:**

1. **Fold Mountains**
- Formed by compression forces
- Created when rock layers fold like fabric
- Example: The Alps, Himalayas

2. **Fault-Block Mountains**
- Formed by tension forces
- Created when rocks break and move vertically
- Example: Sierra Nevada Mountains

3. **Volcanic Mountains**
- Formed by accumulation of volcanic materials
- Created through volcanic activity
- Example: Mount Fuji
